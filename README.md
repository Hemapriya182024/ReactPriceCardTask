# Pricing Cards App

This React application renders pricing cards based on predefined data. Each card represents a different pricing tier with specific features displayed.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of this application deployed on Netlify: [Pricing Cards App](https://mern-react-price-card-task.netlify.app/)

## Components

### App

The `App` component is the main entry point of the application. It maps through an array of pricing data (`cards`) and renders a `Card` component for each pricing tier.

### Card

The `Card` component receives data (`card`) as props and displays:

- **Tag**: Pricing tier (e.g., `FREE`, `PLUS`, `PRO`)
- **Price**: Monthly cost associated with the tier
- **Features**: List of features included in the tier, with conditional styling based on inclusion status (`isIncluded`)
- **Button**: Optional button displayed based on the `btn` property in the card data

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- CSS (for styling)
